# BigMart-Sales-Prediction
# Linear Regression on Item Outlet Sales

This project performs **Linear Regression** to predict `Item_Outlet_Sales` from a dataset containing sales data.  
The model is trained on a `train.csv` dataset and tested on a `test.csv` dataset.  

---

## Features
- Reads `train.csv` and `test.csv` files
- Trains a Linear Regression model using `scikit-learn`
- Predicts sales for both training and testing data
- Calculates Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate model performance

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn

Install required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
